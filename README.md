An MQTT Enabled Hot Tub controller for the Raspberry Pi

3/23/18: This is a mess right now, and not even sure if I will keep it public. It works great, with both MQTT and Traditional GPIO controlled RPi relays. If you're interested let me know and I can explain it to you. Otherwise for now, this is just a test.
